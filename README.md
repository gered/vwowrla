# Vanilla World of Warcraft Raid Log Analyzer

A program and web app UI front-end for doing analysis on combat logs taken with
a Vanilla World of Warcraft 1.12.1 en-US client (Windows or Mac).

**2023-July-11: This project was never finished. It could parse most raid logs I remember throwing at it back when I worked on it, 
but things weren't quite perfect. And it was never actually tested on raid logs from beyond BWL-ish, so probably mostly anything
in there and beyond it will have issues. I'm just making this repository public because it has been sitting as a private repository
here for a long time, collecting dust. Maybe someone will find this useful. But probably not!**

## Why?

Beginning with TBC patch 2.4, Blizzard [changed the combat log format](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Combat_Log)
to be much more complex, but far easier to parse programmatically and do 
complex analysis on, generate statistics from, etc. There have been several
different programs and websites developed since that time to handle log files
using this new format. 

However, the combat logs generated by Vanilla 1.12.1 clients are still in the 
old "human-readable text" format for which there was never really any good 
analyzer/parser program for. 

This project is all about filling that void.
